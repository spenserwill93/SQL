# Media Habits SQL Analysis

This project explores a synthetic dataset named `Media_Habits`, containing detailed information about users’ digital behavior, demographics, and lifestyle choices. The goal is to analyze patterns and trends using SQL—starting from basic queries to more advanced data aggregation and segmentation.

## Dataset Overview

The `Media_Habits` table contains 40+ columns related to:

- Social media and entertainment usage (daily time spent)
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Country, Occupation)
- Lifestyle metrics (Sleep time, Physical activity, Reading, Work/study time)
- Tech savviness, device types, and internet speed
- Wellbeing indicators (Fatigue, Sleep quality, Social isolation)

- ##  Objectives

- Practice SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, COUNT, DISTINCT)
- Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, AVG, SUM)
- Use logical filtering, CASE statements, and subqueries
- Derive behavioral insights and build a foundation for future data visualization

- ## Sample Queries

### 1. Basic Queries
- Retrieve user demographics
- Filter users from specific countries or age groups
- Count total users and unique occupations

### 2. Intermediate Analysis
- Average screen time by country
- Top 5 users with the highest gaming time
- Compare monthly income across occupations
- Segment users by social media engagement score

### 3. Advanced Insights
- Group by tech savviness and calculate average time on educational platforms
- Segment age groups (18–25, 26–35, etc.) to analyze screen time and social isolation
- Identify users with high screen time, poor sleep, and high social isolation
- Determine top-spending countries on entertainment
